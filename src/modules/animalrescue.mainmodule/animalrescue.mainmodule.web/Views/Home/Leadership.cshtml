    We dedicate our time to the most urgent, abused and neglected animals in South Florida. We work diligently to change
    the world for animals through our youth educational programs, tackling the growing over population crisis in our
    community and by helping to provide microchip scanners and training to various police departments in an effort to
    reunite lost pets and keep them out of our local shelters.
