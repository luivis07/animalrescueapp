                            I can’t say enough about Dianne Aikman. Because of her love and dedication to animals ,
                            my
                            family has the best pup ever. We fostered then adopted Luna Marie, a lab/pit mix. Dianne
                            made
                            herself available at all hours when we had any questions or concerns. She went out of
                            her
                            way to
                            make sure Luna was adjusting to her new home and life. Now not only do we have our baby
                            girl
                            we
                            also made a friend for life. Thank you Saving Sage and Dianne Aikman, you give life,
                            hope,
                            joy
                            and love to the animals you rescue and to the families that are lucky enough to adopt
                            them .

                            There is no one that cares more about the animals then the team at Saving Sage. When I
                            adopted
                            my cat from them their every concern was about the heath and well being of my Adora
                            Bella.
                            Seeing how they jump into action when an animal is in need makes you realize how amazing
                            and
                            compassionate this team is. I would highly recommend this shelter, as your pet won’t be
                            forgotten about by their team after you take it home, you become part of the Saving Sage
                            family.

                            My son's dog got out one morning before work I yelled his name walked up and down the
                            street
                            checked his favorite spots and couldn't find him anywhere had to take my son to school
                            went
                            to
                            work stressed out about how I'm going to tell him I did not find him yet went home on my
                            lunch
                            break to check for him and just when I got five minutes back to work I got the call that
                            somebody had ran his microchip and found him! The beautiful part is that a volunteer

                            saving

                            ending
                            I was able to pick my son up from school with his dog in the car it doesn't get better
                            than
                            that
